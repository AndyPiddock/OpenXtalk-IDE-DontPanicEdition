# Remove non-core widgets for LiveCode 8

Some widgets were removed from the IDE, since LiveCode 8.0.0 will lack
some features required to make them work well:

* selector
* radiobutton
* progressbar
* checkbox

Additionally, some widgets intended for use internally by the IDE were
hidden from the tools palette:

* colorswatch
* gradientrampeditor
