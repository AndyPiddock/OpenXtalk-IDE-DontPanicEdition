## The OpenXTalk DON'T PANIC Edition! Inegrated Development Environment (IDE)

This project is an effort to maintain and improve a fork of the legacy Opensource LiveCode Community Edition code base.
LiveCode Ltd. has dropped support for opensource builds (LCC 6.0.1 to 9.6.3) entirely. 
###This means DO NOT ASK LC Ltd. for support for things related to this project in anyway!

For those that may be unfamiliar with the term, xTalk is a family of scripting languages that aspires to be natural-language-esque, syntactically English-like, "programming for the rest of us" which has been built on top of Bill Atkinson's now long-defuct HyperCard (Apple / Claris) and Dan Winkler's HyperTalk Script. xTalk has an even longer history, with concepts originating decades before HyperCard appeared, the "Hyper" in the name stemmming from the concept of HyperText / HyperMedia in the 1960s.

The project is split into two main repos. This repo is for the integrated development (IDE) portion, the front-end that users see. The IDE is, in large part bootstrapped (built with itself), and so in order to make changes, those interested in contributing only need to know LiveCode Script Language or perhaps one of the other xTalk scripting languages (HyperTalk, SuperTalk, MediaTalk, Lingo, SenseTalk, OpenXION, etc.)
