The LCC DON'T PANIC Edition! project is an effort to maintain and improve a fork of the LiveCode Community Edition code base now that LiveCode Ltd. has dropped support for opensource builds.

The project is split into two main repos. This repo is for the integrated development (IDE) portion, the front-end that users see. The IDE is, in large part bootstrapped (built with itself), and so in order to make changes those interested in contributing only need to know LiveCode Script, or perhaps one of the other xTalk (HyperTalk, SuperTalk, SenseTalk, OpenXION, LiveCode Script, etc.) scripting languages.

For those that may be unfamiliar with the term, xTalk is a family of scripting languages that aspires to be natural-language, syntactically English-like, "programming for the rest of us" which has mainly been built on top of Bill Atkinson's now long-defuct HyperCard (Apple / Claris) and Dan Winkler's HyperTalk Script. However xTalk has an even longer history, with concepts originating decades before HyperCard appeared, with the "Hyper" in the name stemmming from the concept of HyperText / HyperMedia in the 1960s.
