The LCC DON'T PANIC Edition! project is an effort to maintain and improve a fork of the LiveCode Community Edition code base now that LiveCode Ltd. has dropped support for opensource builds.

The project is split into two main repos. This repo is for the integrated development (IDE) portion, the front-end that users see. It is in large part bootstrapped (built with itself), and so in oeder to make changes, 

it should help those interested in contributing to at least be familiar with one of the xTalk (HyperTalk, SuperTalk, SenseTalk, OpenXION, LiveCode Script, etc.) family of scripting languages that aspires to be "natural language" and has plain-English-like syntax. 

The xTalk family of languages has mainly been built on top of Bill Atkinson's now long-defuct HyperCard (Apple / Claris) and Dan Winkler's HyperTalk Script that it used. However xTalk has long history, with concepts originating decades before HyperCard appeared, with the "Hyper" in the name stemmming from the concept of HyperText / HyperMedia in the 1960s.
