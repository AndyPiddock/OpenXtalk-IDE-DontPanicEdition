The LCC Don't Panic Edition! project is an effort to maintain and improve a fork of the LiveCode Community Edition now that LiveCode Ltd. has dropped support for opensource builds.

The project is split into two main repos. This repo is for the integrated development (IDE) portion, the front-end that users see. It is in large part bootstrapped (built with itself), and so in oeder to make changes, it would help to at least be familiar with one of the xTalk (HyperCard,SuperCard,LiveCode,etc.) family of Scripting Languages.
